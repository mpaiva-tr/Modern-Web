The following is a compilation of a number of articles I have read. Thanks to [Scott Chacon](https://github.com/schacon) for the great work http://git-scm.com/

# 1. Why Git? - and not SVN?

- Git tracks state, history and integrity of the source tree. 
- SVN only tracks state.
- Especially when merging, Git's extensive use of stored history (across renames and merges) comes handy to make much better informed decisions leading to less conflicts.
- Having a complete, cryptographically verifiable integrity chain through the repository helps build trust in the underlying systems, or detect when they fail. 
- On the downside it can be complicated to create "clean" patches. Having a proper workflow helps.
- Finally, Git works locally by default, giving it a unbelievably huge boost in contrast to SVN which must go to the central repo for almost any operation.

# 2. Git Software

## Git Gui Client 
Git comes with built-in GUI tools for committing (git-gui) and browsing (gitk), but there are several third-party tools for users looking for platform-specific experience.

- http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis

## Visual Studio Plugin
[GitExtensions](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitextensions/) has a Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 plugin.

## Documentation
Start with the GIT Reference http://gitref.org/. Below, you will find my humble notes to get you up and running.

# 3. Installing Git
Let’s get into using some Git. First things first—you have to install it. You can get it a number of ways; the two major ones are to install it from source or to install an existing package for your platform:

## Git on Mac
There are two easy ways to install Git on a Mac. The easiest is to use the graphical Git installer, which you can download from the Google Code page:

- http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer

The other way is via the Terminal app. Copy and paste the following command line:

    sudo port install git-core +svn +doc +bash_completion +gitweb

## Git on Windows
Installing Git on Windows is very easy. The msysGit project has one of the easier installation procedures. Simply download the installer exe file from the GitHub page, and run it:

- http://msysgit.github.com/

After it’s installed, you have both a command-line version (including an SSH client that will come in handy later) and the standard GUI.

## Git on Linux
If you want to install Git on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so through the basic package-management tool that comes with your distribution. If you’re on Fedora, you can use yum:

    yum install git-core

Or if you’re on a Debian-based distribution like Ubuntu, try apt-get:

    apt-get install git

# 4. First-time Git Config
Now that you have Git on your system, you’ll want to do a few things to customize your Git environment. You should have to do these things only once; they’ll stick around between upgrades. You can also change them at any time by running through the commands again.

Git comes with a tool called `git config` that lets you get and set configuration variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates. 

## Your Identity
The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and e-mail address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you pass around:

    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

## Your Editor
Now that your identity is set up, you can configure the default text editor that will be used when Git needs you to type in a message. By default, Git uses your system’s default editor, which is generally **Vi** or **Vim**. If you want to use a different text editor, such as **Emacs**, you can do the following:

    git config --global core.editor emacs

### For Sublime Text 2

The first task is to make a symlink to subl. Assuming you've placed Sublime Text 2 in the Applications folder, and that you have a ~/bin directory in your path, you can run:

    ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" ~/bin/subl
    
If you don't have the `bin` directory, you can do the following to install the `subl` command:

    cd 
    mkdir bin
    sudo ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /

Now let's set Sublime Text as Git's default editor, by running the following line:

    git config --global core.editor "subl -n -w"
    
Since we are dealing with Sublime Text, let me just mention that there's a plugin to run Git from ST2, check the following for more info:

- https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-2-git
 
## Your Diff Tool

Another useful option you may want to configure is the default diff tool to use to resolve merge conflicts. Say you want to use vimdiff:

    git config --global merge.tool vimdiff
    
To use **Sublime Text 2** as Git's diff tool, here's a good plugin:

- https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter
 

Then run the following to set ST2 as the default Git Diff tool:

    git config --global merge.tool subl

## Checking your Settings

If you want to check your settings, you can use the `git config --list` command to list all the settings Git can find at that point:

    git config --list
    user.name=Marcelo Paiva
    user.email=marcelo.paiva@thomsonreuters.com
    color.status=auto
    color.branch=auto
    color.interactive=auto
    color.diff=auto
    ...

You can also check what Git thinks a specific key’s value is by typing git config {key}:

    $ git config user.name
    Marcelo Paiva
    
# 5. Getting Help

If you ever need help while using Git, there are three ways to get the manual page (manpage) help for any of the Git commands:

    git help <verb>
    git <verb> --help
    man git-<verb>

For example, you can get the manpage help for the config command by running

    git help config


# 6. Git Basics

You can get a Git project using two main approaches. The first takes an existing project or directory and imports it into Git. The second clones an existing Git repository from another server.

## git init

Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory - If you’re starting to track an existing project in Git, you need to go to the project’s directory and enter

    cd ~/myProjectFolder
    git init

This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files — a Git repository skeleton.

## git add
If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit. You can accomplish that with a few `git add` commands that specify the files you want to track, followed by a commit:

    git add *.c
    git add README
    git commit -m 'initial project version'

## git clone
If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository — for example, a project you’d like to contribute to — the command you need is `git clone` - not `checkout` like others.

You clone a repository with `git clone [url]`. For example, if you want to clone the Ruby Git library called Grit, you can do so like this:

    git clone git://github.com/schacon/grit.git

If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than `grit`, you can specify that as the next command-line option:

    git clone git://github.com/schacon/grit.git mygrit

## git status
The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the git status command. If you run this command directly after a clone, you should see something like this:

    git status
    # On branch master
    nothing to commit (working directory clean)

This means you have a clean working directory — in other words, no tracked files are modified. 

## Other commands

Most of the built in aliases for git will help because they are similar to CVS.

### git pull 
- This will pull a fresh copy of the repository.

### git commit 
- This will commit changes to your local repository (not the server).

### git push 
- This is what moves your local repository to the server you checked out from.

### git status 
- Shows you the status of your repository.

### git diff 
- Gives you a diff of the file.

### git rm 
- This lets you remove files and directories.

# 7. Git and GitHub
Your email address for Git should be the same one associated with your GitHub account. If it is not, see the link below for help adding additional emails to your GitHub account.

- https://help.github.com/articles/how-do-i-change-my-primary-email-address

if you've been following this guide from the beginning, you have already set your **Name** and **Email**, but just in case, here's a quick recap:

**1. Name** - Tell Git your name, so that it can properly label the commits you make.

    git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"

**2. Email** - Git saves your email address into the commits you make. We use the email address to associate your commits with your GitHub account.

    git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
    
**3. Password Caching** - The last option we need to set will tell git that you don't want to type your username and password every time you talk to a remote server.    

To use this option, you need to install the osxkeychain credential helper and tell git to use it. If you installed git using homebrew, you should already have the osxkeychain helper. You can verify this by trying to run it:

    git credential-osxkeychain

If you do not have the helper, you can download and install it like so:

    curl http://github-media-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/osx/git-credential-osxkeychain -o git-credential-osxkeychain
    sudo mkdir /usr/local
    sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin
    sudo mv git-credential-osxkeychain /usr/local/bin/
    sudo chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/git-credential-osxkeychain

To tell git to use osxkeychain, simply set the global git config:

    git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

The next time you clone an HTTPS URL that requires a password you will be prompted for your username and password, and to grant access to the OS X keychain. After you've done this, the username and password are stored in your keychain and you won't be required to type them in to git again.

Note: If this doesn't work, try updating git to a newer version.
