# Why Git and not SVN?

Git vs. SVN: git tracks state, history and integrity of the source tree. SVN only tracks state.
Especially when merging, git's extensive use of stored history (across renames and merges) comes handy to make much better informed decisions leading to less conflicts.

Having a complete, cryptographically verifiable integrity chain through the repository helps build trust in the underlying systems, or detect when they fail. On the downside it can be complicated to create "clean" patches. Having a proper workflow helps.

Finally, git works locally by default, giving it a unbelievably huge boost in contrast to SVN which must go to the central repo for almost any operation.

Software: See this question, there are several standalone GUIs for working with the repo, history browsers and shell extensions.

Studio Plugin: "GitExtensions":http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitextensions/ has a Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 plugin.

Documentation: Start with the GIT User's Manual. There are more links to tutorials and books on git-scm.com.
