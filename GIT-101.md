The following is a compilation of a number of articles I have read. Thanks to [Scott Chacon](https://github.com/schacon) for the great work http://git-scm.com/

# 1. Why Git? - and not SVN?

- Git tracks state, history and integrity of the source tree. 
- SVN only tracks state.
- Especially when merging, Git's extensive use of stored history (across renames and merges) comes handy to make much better informed decisions leading to less conflicts.
- Having a complete, cryptographically verifiable integrity chain through the repository helps build trust in the underlying systems, or detect when they fail. 
- On the downside it can be complicated to create "clean" patches. Having a proper workflow helps.
- Finally, Git works locally by default, giving it a unbelievably huge boost in contrast to SVN which must go to the central repo for almost any operation.

# 2. Git Software

## Git Gui Client 
Git comes with built-in GUI tools for committing (git-gui) and browsing (gitk), but there are several third-party tools for users looking for platform-specific experience.

- http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis

## Visual Studio Plugin
[GitExtensions]:(http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitextensions/) has a Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 plugin.

## Documentation
Start with the GIT Reference http://gitref.org/. Below, you will find my humble notes to get you up and running.

# 3. Installing Git
Let’s get into using some Git. First things first—you have to install it. You can get it a number of ways; the two major ones are to install it from source or to install an existing package for your platform:

## Git on Mac
There are two easy ways to install Git on a Mac. The easiest is to use the graphical Git installer, which you can download from the Google Code page:

- http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer

The other way is via the Terminal app. Copy and paste the following command line:

    sudo port install git-core +svn +doc +bash_completion +gitweb

## Git on Windows
Installing Git on Windows is very easy. The msysGit project has one of the easier installation procedures. Simply download the installer exe file from the GitHub page, and run it:

- http://msysgit.github.com/

After it’s installed, you have both a command-line version (including an SSH client that will come in handy later) and the standard GUI.

## Git on Linux
If you want to install Git on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so through the basic package-management tool that comes with your distribution. If you’re on Fedora, you can use yum:

    yum install git-core

Or if you’re on a Debian-based distribution like Ubuntu, try apt-get:

    apt-get install git

# 4. First-time Git Config
Now that you have Git on your system, you’ll want to do a few things to customize your Git environment. You should have to do these things only once; they’ll stick around between upgrades. You can also change them at any time by running through the commands again.

Git comes with a tool called `git config` that lets you get and set configuration variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates. 

## Your Identity
The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and e-mail address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you pass around:

    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

## Your Editor
Now that your identity is set up, you can configure the default text editor that will be used when Git needs you to type in a message. By default, Git uses your system’s default editor, which is generally **Vi** or **Vim**. If you want to use a different text editor, such as **Emacs**, you can do the following:

    git config --global core.editor emacs

### For Sublime Text 2

The first task is to make a symlink to subl. Assuming you've placed Sublime Text 2 in the Applications folder, and that you have a ~/bin directory in your path, you can run:

    ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" ~/bin/subl
    
If you don't have the `bin` directory, you can do the following to install the `subl` command:

    cd 
    mkdir bin
    sudo ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /

Now let's set Sublime Text as Git's default editor, by running the following line:

    git config --global core.editor "subl -n -w"
    
Since we are dealing with Sublime Text, let me just mention that there's a plugin to run Git from ST2, check the following for more info:

- https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-2-git
 
## Your Diff Tool

Another useful option you may want to configure is the default diff tool to use to resolve merge conflicts. Say you want to use vimdiff:

    git config --global merge.tool vimdiff
    
To use **Sublime Text 2** as Git's diff tool, here's a good plugin:

- https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter
 

Then run the following to set ST2 as the default Git Diff tool:

    git config --global merge.tool subl

## Checking your Settings

If you want to check your settings, you can use the `git config --list` command to list all the settings Git can find at that point:

    git config --list
    user.name=Marcelo Paiva
    user.email=marcelo.paiva@thomsonreuters.com
    color.status=auto
    color.branch=auto
    color.interactive=auto
    color.diff=auto
    ...

You can also check what Git thinks a specific key’s value is by typing git config {key}:

    $ git config user.name
    Marcelo Paiva
    
# 5. Getting Help

If you ever need help while using Git, there are three ways to get the manual page (manpage) help for any of the Git commands:

    git help <verb>
    git <verb> --help
    man git-<verb>

For example, you can get the manpage help for the config command by running

    git help config
